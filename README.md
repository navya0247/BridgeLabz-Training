✔️Solved three scenario based quetions :-

✔️ First one is Custom Furniture Manufacturing, where the task focused on optimizing wooden rod cutting for furniture. It involved determining the best cut to maximize earnings for a 12 ft rod, applying a fixed waste constraint given by the customer, and suggesting cuts that balance maximum revenue with minimal waste.


✔️ Second one is Metal Factory Pipe Cutting, which focused on maximizing revenue from cutting metal rods. The scenarios included identifying the best cutting strategy for a rod of length 8 using a given price chart, analyzing the impact of a custom-length order on overall revenue, and comparing optimized versus non-optimized cutting strategies to observe revenue differences.

✔️ Third one is LoanBuddy – Loan Approval Automation, which involved designing a backend loan approval engine for a fintech application. The task focused on collecting applicant details, verifying eligibility, automating loan approval decisions using custom rules, calculating EMIs, and generating personalized repayment plans.
