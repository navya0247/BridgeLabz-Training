✔️🚑 AmbulanceRoute

📌 Story Context
A hospital campus has multiple units connected in a circular route:

Emergency → Radiology → Surgery → ICU → Emergency

When an ambulance arrives, the system must quickly locate the nearest available unit for treatment.
The navigation system is implemented using a Circular Linked List, ensuring continuous traversal.

⚙️ Program Requirements & Features

🔹 Each node represents a hospital unit

🔹 The list is circular — last node points back to the first

🔹 System rotates through units until an available unit is found.

🧠 Concepts Used
🔹 Circular Linked List.
